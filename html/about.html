              Five <span>engineers</span>, one lab
            </h1>
            <p>
              Asta Epsilon Infotronics is run by five computer engineering students from Kolkata who treat every project like a lab experiment: define the problem, design the system, measure the results, then iterate.
            </p>
            <p>
              Between classes, research work, and hackathons, the team prototypes websites, software tools, printable graphics, and IoT devices that are actually used on campus and by early-stage clients.
            </p>
            <p class="about-tagline">
              The group is small on purpose, so every build has a clear owner and a fast response loop.
            </p>

              Whether it is a website, a desktop tool, a batch of posters, or a sensor module, the team designs it as if it will be deployed in a production environment, not just submitted for marks.

              <h3>Practical engineering, not demos</h3>
              <p>
                Code is written to be readable and maintainable, with simple stacks that work on real hosting and hardware, so you are not locked into student-only tech or one specific developer.
              </p>

              <h3>Technical stories made visual</h3>
              <p>
                Posters, flyers, and logos are built around grids, hierarchy, and legible type so your technical message stands out on notice boards, timelines, and project reports.
              </p>

              <h3>From breadboard to usable unit</h3>
              <p>
                Sensors and small devices are wired, tested, and documented with clear labels and connection diagrams so you can plug them into your own systems without guesswork.

              <h3>Direct access to builders</h3>
              <p>
                You talk to the same students who are actually designing your solution, which keeps feedback cycles short and reduces miscommunication compared to larger agencies.

              <h3>Student pricing, pro mindset</h3>
              <p>
                Rates reflect a student studio, but the team still ships with estimates, milestones, and handover docs so you know what you are getting and when.

              <h3>Built to evolve</h3>
              <p>
                Each project leaves room for upgrades, whether that means adding new pages, features, or attaching more sensors later, so your first version is not a dead end.
